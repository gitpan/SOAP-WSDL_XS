INSTALLING ON WINDOWS
=====================

SOAP-WSDL_XS has successfully been compiled on windows using either
MinGW/MSYS/gcc or Visual Studio 2005

Only the MinGW/MSYS/gcc variant is described here - to compile with Visual
Studio, you'll need to a add .manifest XML files for the resulting dll.

Installing on Windows using MinGW/MSYS/gcc
------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

Install MinGW and MSYS. You may follow the instructions from
http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml
It's probably easiest to just use the installer package for MinGW and MSYS.
You need at least MinGW, gcc, w32api and MSYS.

Install expat libraries (http://expat.sourceforge.net/) The expat_win32
package from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10127 is the
right one.

Install SOAP-WSDL >= 2.01.

Install ExtUtils-CBuilder >= 0.24. Older versions of ExtUtils::CBuilder have 
a bug which prevents the propagation of compiler flags from the build file to 
your C compiler.

You may try to install both through CPAN or via ppm (if available).

Preparations
------------

1. Start MSYS. You should see a bash-like shell.
Note that C: is /c/ in MSYS.

2. Setup environment:

You'll have to setup a few environment variables for the header and library
files to be found.

This is where I have my expat installation's header files

   @> export CPATH='/c/Program Files/Expat 2.0.1/Source/lib'

This is where my perl-related dlls lives
I've already copied my expat library to perl's bin path. If you have not, you
probably have to add the path to libexpat.dll here.

   @> export LIBRARY_PATH='/c/perl/bin'

Building
--------

1. Unwrap SOAP-WSDL_XS into a directory
2. go there
   @>cd /d/workspace/SOAP-WSDL_XS

3. Run the following mantra:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test

Installing
----------

You may install SOAP-WSDL_XS with

   perl Build install

Note however, that you need to copy libexpat.dll to somewhere in your path.

I copied it to C:\Perl\bin for convenience.

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

 Can't load 'C:/Perl/site/lib/auto/SOAP/WSDL/Expat/MessageParser_XS/
 MessageParser_XS.dll' for module SOAP::WSDL::Expat::MessageParser_XS: 
 load_file:The specified module could not be found at C:/Perl/lib/DynaLoader.pm 
 line 229.

If you get this message (path may vary according to your perl's location), your 
system probably can't find libexpat.dll. You'll need to add it's location to
your "PATH" environment variable, or copy it to a location in your path 
(I usually use "C:\Perl\bin"). 

See the "Prerequisites" section on where to get libexpat.dll
